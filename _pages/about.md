I am a Ph.D. student of Computer Science at Virginia Tech advised by [Dr. Chris Brown](https://chbrown13.github.io/) and Dr. Yan Chen. My research interests lie in software engineering, natural Language processing and human computer interaction. I am particularly passionate about using natural language processing techniques to improve the software development process and computer science teaching methodology. Previously, I received my Master of Science degree in Software Engineering from Rochester Institute of Technology advised by Dr. Mohamed Wiem Mkaouer.
